I'm a developer and keyboard designer from the Swedish north. My passion for building and technology has taken me to many places and found me many friends.

You may know me from Stadia+ or one of my many other projects which I have been making since childhood, it is not often ones path in life is so well paved as it has been for me, I'm grateful for that. At 11 I wrote my first program, it was a top down videogame made in GameMaker: Studio and following a Heartbeast guide I was frankly too dumb to understand. The game sucked but got me hooked to the process. Since then my erratic brain and I have traveled through many different fields of programming and development, eventually landing me a job at Swedish design agency [Anyday](https://anyday.se "Anyday") when I was 18. I've worked there since, though in 2023 I'm going off to widen my views a bit by traveling down to Linköping for studies.

It's taken me a while to build this website. It's not complex or fancy in any way, a Svelte app running off a TinaCMS backed Vite backend, but there's something very difficult in building something like a home page. It represents me not just graphically and through the content on it, but spiritually as well. What does this website make you think of me, does it tell you anything? I'm unsure if it does. I ended up cowardly falling back onto a simple design, just text and an image. It is hard to judge text and an image.

I do many things - too many things probably. I played the trumpet for ten years (eleven if you count this year, though I've hardly played much recently) and it's a hobby I hold dear, I have many fond memories of playing music. Another hobby I've picked up recently is drawing, it's frustrating although the progress I'm making helps a lot with motivation. Sometimes I have moments where it puts me almost in a trance which is cool. One day I'll be as good as Da Vinci, probably.

In the last few years I've spent an irresponsible amount of money on keyboards and keyboard accessories. It started off as a desire to have something better than my old 60 euro MX red board, but quickly snowballed into a more vague enjoyment in putting things together. I blame Lego, I'm sure they're responsible somehow. As a way to make it a little more educational I started [Tangent Keyboards](https://github.com/TangentKeyboards "Tangent Keyboards") with my friend Elias. We haven't released anything yet, but make steady progress. It's fun to put things together and see if they work.

I'll make a fancy widget for my social media handles soon, but until then here's a bullet list:
