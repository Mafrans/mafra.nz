The LiU Fall Game Jam is hosted once every year by the game jam division of
LiTHe Kod, Link√∂ping University's student run programming club. This was
my first year participating, and my second in-person game jam. It was
a lot of fun and we ended up with a game that was genuinely enjoyable to play
and fun to compete in.

## Characters and Animation

Animating characters for a video game is always a challenge, especially
during a game jam, where the end result is not really known until late
in the project. This project was my first real venture into the world of character
animation, and it was a really fun challenge. To speed up the process,
we decided to produce prototype sketches early on, which were then animated
quickly and added to the game so that we could get a feel for which
animations would be necessary and which would not.

The sketch above sadly did not ever make it into the game, but the running
animation was sketched in a similar manner and then inked and colored in
a simple manner not too dissimilar from older Adobe Flash style games.

## Level design and art

When levels change as much as they do in a game jam context, it can be
difficult to adapt the artwork. We decided to on an approach where the
level would first be blocked out by our level designer, then I would simply
paint over the blocks with a single large image. This resulted in a relatively
fast workflow, but came with flaws like the images taking a lot of texture
space and therefore not being visible in a webgl context and the levels
collision mesh not matching perfectly to the artwork.

## Colors and communication

A key part of making a good game is communicating to the player what you
expect them to do in any scenario. This was magnified by the pace our
game ended up playing at. As a result, I put special effort into coding
the art in such a way that the player can easily tell what is dangerous and
what is not. Solid surfaces are indicated by harsh black inked lines contrasting
the gray-blue backgrounds, environments have muted colors to make interactions
pop, and anything dangerous is marked with a neon red. It makes for a game
that is easy to understand out of the box.
