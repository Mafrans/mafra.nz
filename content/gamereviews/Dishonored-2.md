title: Dishonored 2
rating: 7.8
excerpt: >-
  Building off it's predecessor, there was no doubt that Dishonored 2 would be a
  great game, but I don't think it managed to reproduce the appeal of the
  original. Dishonored 2 is a much less finely crafted game, with less options,
  more obvious storytelling and a more systematic questing.
