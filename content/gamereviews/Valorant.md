title: Valorant
rating: 8.3
excerpt: >-
  Building a shooter to compete with CS:GO is no easy feat, and I think Riot's
  second major title has done an excellent job at putting its own spin on the
  ancient formula. The ability system makes for more accessible and intuitive
  gameplay that even new players can pick up.
